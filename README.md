### ‚ùÑ HOW DOES IT WORK?

The way this datapack works is very simple. You just right click, while sneaking, with a snow layer the base of any [supported block](#üßä-supported-blocks) to turn it into a "snow-logged" block!

Make sure to also use the provided resource pack, otherwise you won't be able to see the "snow-logged" blocks!

Everyone can contribute!

### üìÉ CREDITS

This datapack is a slightly modified version of the [Carpet on Stairs Datapack](https://github.com/oOBoomberOo/carpet_on_stairs) by **oOBoomberOo**. Basically all the functions and commands remained untouched, so all credits goes to him for the original work and idea! üòÅ

### üòÅ IN CONCLUSION

I hope you like this datapack and the effort put into it to keep it always updated!

I'll support the datapack, and add more blocks as needed, with new versions of Minecraft.

In the meantime I wish you all the best, have a nice day,

**_Jimi_** ü§òüèº

### üßä SUPPORTED BLOCKS

The supported blocks can be found inside the `#snow_on_stairs:snowable` tag. Changing the entries in this list will change the list of blocks that can be "snow-logged". This also mean that other datapacks or mods can add their blocks to this list, if they aren't already in other Minecraft Tags (for instance, if a modded stair is inside the `stairs` tag, it will be automatically supported by the datapack!)

The `#snow_on_stairs:snowable` tag can be used inside the Minecraft inventory to quickly see the list of supported blocks.
